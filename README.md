# 🌐 TCP Connection Monitor (PowerShell)

A lightweight, continuous PowerShell script to monitor TCP port availability and latency on a remote server. It displays real-time results in the console, with optional logging to a file.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Prerequisites

### Execution

1. Save the script as `monitor_connection.ps1`.

2. Open a PowerShell console.

3. Execute the script with the mandatory `-Server` and `-Port` parameters.

### Examples

**1. Monitor connection every 5 seconds (Console Only):**

.\monitor_connection.ps1 -Server "www.google.com" -Port 80


**2. Monitor and log results to a file every 10 seconds:**

.\monitor_connection.ps1 -Server "your.api.endpoint" -Port 443 -LogFile "C:\Logs\tcp_monitor_log.txt" -IntervalSeconds 10


**3. Stop the script:**

Press `Ctrl+C` in the PowerShell console where the script is running.
